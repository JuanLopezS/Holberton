### What is "the Shell"?

Simply put, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne)

### What's a "Terminal?"
It's a program called a terminal emulator. This is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.

**A shell prompt** that contains your user name and the name of the machine followed by a dollar sign

**A shebang** is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script.
* **man** - an interface to the on-line reference manuals
 *      1.   Executable programs or shell commands
 *      2.   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
 *      3.   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
 *      4.   Special files (usually found in /dev)
 *      5.   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
 *      6.   Games
 *      7.   Miscellaneous  (including  macro  packages and conven‐
           tions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
 *      8.   System administration commands (usually only for root)
 *      9.   Kernel routines [Non standard]
